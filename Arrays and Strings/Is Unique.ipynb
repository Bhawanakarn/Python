#  Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
# What if you cannot use additional data structures?
# Assume that the characters are ASCII charatcers of 128 characters
#examples:
#abcdd = False
#abcdef = True
#apple = False
#cat = True

#PLAN-----------------------
#Base case: if the length of the inputlist is greater than 128 then return false
# because it is not possible to have all unique characters if the table only consists of 128 unique char
#then make an empty dictionary
#run a for loop to the inputlist
#   check if the character is already in dictionary
#       then immediately return FALSE
#   else
#       store the character in the dictionary
#return TRUE

# arr=[5,6,3,4]
# for i in arr:
#     print(i)
